setting - kinda fantasy/ a little steampunk'ish.


look - bright/dark. grey-style machinery afflicted.


cool stuff - you play as an old wizard, who got lost in a library. while you were there for eons, nobody cared and the world moved on.
nobody cares about yuor magic and you question your life during the game. you have no real goal, and dont know what to do.
meanwhile something going on.

you can put "buffs" on yourself in form of android-like mechanical shit. like cyber eyes, hair etc.

point - there are known and secret labs in the world, where you can get these upgrades with quasi-random chances of it being shitty or great. proportionally to price ofc. failures should have permanent effects.
roguelike mechanic, which can shape the world according to past actions? like you can side with another fraction, but the consequences are saved?
You acn also use your magic, which should account for machine-type instead of magic affinity(fire/ice/light etc)

Game should have several fractions, based at least on snowy region/ machine region, swamp and whatever. fractions don't have to be based on creature race, that's fucking dumb. Base on beliefs. Maybe color code them.
Quests - something to do with faction "war", steal items, murder, set up another faction by putting stolen item to someones inventory, etc.
Put lots of betrayal, base game on mistrust, and common feeling of uncertainty. brain games, but only if they are good.
map can be random generated but with chunks and biomes
cities - FF brave exvius style?
